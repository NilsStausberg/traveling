# Traveling salesman problem

## Project 
The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a long-standing and often discussed issue in computational physics and operations research: a traveling salesperson has to find the shortest closed tour between a ceratin set of cities, where each city is only visited once during the tour.

Naturally, this problem has applications in many every-day problems, e.g. in finding directions using a route guiding system. Optimizations can be archieved with respect to differen funcitons, e.g. the shortest path, the quickest path, and others.

The following development of the algorithm is mostly inspired by a paper "Optimization of the time-dependent traveling salesman problem with Monte Carlo method" by Johannes Bentner et al. (**paper.pdf**).

The data which is used, can be found in the folder **data/** and consits out of 127 beer garden, distributed around Augsburg, Germany.
